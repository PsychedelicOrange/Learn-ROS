This task has msgs and services to control and monitor turtlesim apllication and explains nodes.
This task also contains listener and talker scripts , teaching us basic communication between nodes and teaches us about subscription.
NOTES:
There was a talker and listner script already located in the ros_tutorials package which was added earlier in the tutorial. It was causing some isuues
in catkin make command. Since this was an issue for the sake of the tutorial i ran caking make isolated , which builds each package separately,but thus is a lot slower.
